							<h3>SPECQUE: European Parliament Simulation</h3>
							<p>
								<i>July 2022</i><br>
								I had the chance to join SPECQUE, the world's largest Francophone simulation of the European Parliament, in Canada! The event was a mix of learning about EU institutions and meeting youths from various cities like Paris, Brussels, and Prague. 
								Hosted by UniversitÃ© Laval in QuÃ©bec, this intense and memorable experience was made possible by the support from the University of LiÃ¨ge, various professors, and friends and family. A big thank you to everyone involved!

							<h3>Study Room Initiative in Verviers</h3>
							<p>
								<i> August 2019</i><br>
								With other councillors and Mrs Belly, I helped initiate the first study room in Verviers for college students. Itâ€™s a free space where students can prepare for exams from Monday to Friday, 9 am to 9 pm. The announcement of this new facility generated over 100 student registrations within a week. Weâ€™re proud to meet this need after three years of demand, enhancing the study environment for local students.

							<h3>Advocating for Student Support in Verviers</h3>
							<p>
								<i> April 2019</i><br>
								During the city council, I addressed the city college, voicing my concerns regarding the â‚¬500,000 allocated for modernizing the current library. I emphasized the importance of involving students in discussions to truly understand their needs and make meaningful enhancements to the library. Specifically, I highlighted the critical need for dedicated study spaces and more accommodating schedules during the exam preparation period.

							<h3>Parlement Jeunesse Secretary Role</h3>
							<p>
								<i> February 2019</i><br>
								As a Secretary at Parlement Jeunesse, I was appointed at the start of the session and was one of four, representing each parliamentary group. My primary responsibility was to assist with the smooth running of sessions, including organizing debates, setting agendas, conducting votes, and recording minutes. I also assisted in committees, ensuring amendments were properly recorded, and had deliberative voting rights. I participated actively in debates and discussions, ensuring a seamless flow of parliamentary procedures.
